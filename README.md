TUAS Workspace reservation
=====
This application is a group work for the Sovellusprojekti-course.

The aim for this group work is to create a Flask based web service by using Python and RESTful API.

A web service shortly described:

"TUAS  has  a  lot  of  free  workspaces  after  16  and  before  21  oâ€™clock  during  weekdays.  Auditoriums,  meeting rooms,  classrooms  etc.  A web  serviceis  needed  where  a  client  can createor  cancel  a  reservation  for  a workspace.A  client  can  be  anyone,  even outside  TUAS. It should  also  be  possible  to  add, edit  and  delete clients and workspacesinto the system. Of course, the clients themselves should not be able to create, edit or change the workspaces. For reasons of privacy, they also should not be able to  view, edit or delete the information  of  the  other  clients.Listings  of  clients,  workspaces  and  reservations  should  be  available.  The system  should  watch  over  that  duplicate  reservations  are  not  possible.Itshould  also  keep  record  of  data creation dates and times, as well as the dates and times of last modifications."
